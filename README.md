Just a simple Dockerfile to allow installation of additionnal LaTeX packages.

Cause the official Sharelatex image provide TeX Live 2017, `tlmgr` need an upgrade (seeâ€¯: [TeXLive package manager requires an upgrade issue][texlive package manager issue 90]).

Also add some packages for physics papers [see the Dockerfile][list latex packages].
